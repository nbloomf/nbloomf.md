My name is Nathan Bloomfield and this is where I take notes.

I like to think about the (strange|beautiful) interaction between universal algebra and programming. Sometimes I write about that too.

Many of the posts here are [literate programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), which is fun. When I'm learning a thing I like to jot down little programs to try it out, and the literate style is good for this. Also it means my blog posts have unit tests. :)
