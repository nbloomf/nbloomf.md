I am trying to learn more about this hip "Machine Learning" thing the kids are all talking about. I'm the type that learns best about a thing by writing, so that's what this is.

1. [Indices](/posts/ml/Indices.html) and canonical [isomorphisms](/posts/ml/IndexIsos.html) among them.
2. [Tensors](/posts/ml/Tensors.html) and [tests](/posts/ml/Tests/Tensor.html) of their properties.
3. [Gradients](/posts/ml/Gradients.html)
4. [Supervised Learning](/posts/ml/SupervisedLearning.html)
