I am trying to learn more about this hip "Machine Learning" thing the kids are all talking about. I'm the type that learns best about a thing by writing, so that's what this is.

1. Prologue
2. Tensors
    * [Sizes and Indices](/posts/ml/Indices.html) and canonical [isomorphisms](/posts/ml/IndexIsos.html) among them.
    * [Tensors](/posts/ml/Tensors.html) and [tests](/posts/ml/Test/Tensors.html) of their properties.
    * [Tensor Functions](/posts/ml/TensorFunctions.html)
3. Optimization
    * [Gradients](/posts/ml/Gradients.html)
    * [Gradient Checking](/posts/ml/GradientChecking.html)
    * [Gradient Descent](/posts/ml/GradientDescent.html)
4. Supervised Learning
    * [Supervised Learning](/posts/ml/SupervisedLearning.html)
