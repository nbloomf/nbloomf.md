* [**Munch**](/munch/munch.html)

    Reimplementation of parsec. This is a learning project.

* [**Mycelium**](/mycelium/Mycelium.html)

    A basic proof checker for intuitionistic logic over simply typed lambda calculus.

* [**Machine Learning Notes**](/pages/ml.html)

    Just like it says on the tin.

* [**wordcereal**](https://github.com/nbloomf/wordcereal)

    A word list for encoding bits as grammatically correct sentences.

* [**hakyll-shortcode**](https://github.com/nbloomf/hakyll-shortcode)

    WordPress-style shortcodes for [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/). (Side note: why are so many of my projects in Haskell? I should branch out...)

* [**Yentl**](http://github.com/nbloomf/yentl)

    A synthetic geometry DSL in Haskell.

* [**Haskify**](http://github.com/nbloomf/haskify)

    This is a Haskell client library for the [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com) REST API. Originally built for use in some tools supporting [Gingiber](http://www.gingiber.com). It's kind of garbage, but I learned a lot. :)

* [**Software Tools in Haskell**](/pages/sth/index.html)

    As a learning project I'm (slowly) reading through the book *Software Tools* by Kernighan and Plauger and porting the example programs to Haskell. This project includes code, documentation, and lots of thinking on paper.

* [**Feivel**](http://github.com/nbloomf/feivel)

    A templating language for math education.

* [**Arithmetic Made Difficult**](/pages/amd.html)

    Wherein we develop some elementary number theory in excruciating detail from a category-ish perspective. With proofs and programs.
