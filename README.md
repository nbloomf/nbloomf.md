# nbloomf.md

This is the source of nbloomf.github.io, which is generated using Hakyll.

Note to self: nbloomf.md and nbloomf.github.io should be kept in the same directory so that "make move" will work.

* make site: compile the generator
* make build: generate the site
* make watch: host the site at localhost:8000
* make move: copy generated site to nbloomf.github.io
