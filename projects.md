* [**Software Tools in Haskell**](/pages/sth/index.html)

    As a learning project I'm (slowly) reading through the book *Software Tools* by Kernighan and Plauger and porting the example programs to Haskell. This project includes code, documentation, and lots of thinking on paper.

* [**Arithmetic Made Difficult**](/pages/amd/index.html)

    Wherein we develop some elementary number theory in excruciating detail from a category-ish perspective. With proofs and programs.
