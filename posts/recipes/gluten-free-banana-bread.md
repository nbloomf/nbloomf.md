Mildly adapted from [Gimme Delicious](http://gimmedelicious.com/2014/12/14/the-best-ever-super-moist-gluten-free-banana-bread/).

* * *

**Time:** 20 minutes prep plus 50 minutes in the oven

**Ingredients:**

* 2 cups Bob's Red Mill gluten free flour
* 5 very ripe bananas, mashed (1½ cups)
* ½ cup turbinado sugar
* ½ cup butter (1 stick), softened
* 2 eggs
* 2 tablespoons milk
* ½ teaspoon vanilla
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* ½-1 cup chocolate chips (optional)
* Cinnamon (optional)

**Directions:**

1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan, set aside.

2. In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt, set aside.

3. In a separate bowl or stand mixer, cream together butter and sugar. Stir in eggs, milk, vanilla, and mashed bananas until well blended. Add a little cinnamon here if you want.

4. Stir flour mixture into banana mixture, then add chocolate chips. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.

5. Bake in preheated oven for 50 to 55 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let bread cool in pan for at least minutes. Serve warm.

**Notes:** The original recipe calls for refined sugar, but I subbed [granulated turbinado sugar](http://www.intheraw.com/products/sugar-in-the-raw) and it turned out really well; in this case I left out the chocolate chips and sprinkled just enough sugar on top to make it crispy.
