**Time:** 50 minutes.

**Ingredients:**

* 1 pouch roasted garlic mashed potato mix (if feeling adventurous, make potatoes from scratch; they taste better)
* 2 tbsp. butter
* ½ cup milk
* 3 slices bacon
* ¾ cup shredded cheddar cheese
* 1 large egg
* 2 tablespoons chopped chives
* 1½ cup panko bread crumbs
* 4 cups vegetable oil (optional, for frying)

**Directions:**

1. Cook the mashed potatoes, with the milk and butter, according to package directions. Let them cool to room temperature.
2. Cook your bacon until crispy. Set aside on paper towels. Once cool, crumble into bacon bits.
3. In a large bowl, combine the potatoes, cheese, egg, chives, and bacon bits. Mix until thoroughly combined. Using your hands, roll mixture into 1-inch balls. Toss in the panko bread crumbs until completely covered. Set aside on a plate to rest 15 minutes.
4. Heat the oil in a large, wide pot. Once the oil is hot enough, gently lower the balls into the oil and fry until golden all over. Continue frying in batches and set aside on paper towels to drain.
5. Garnish with extra chives and serve immediately. 


**Notes:**

I prefer to bake these at 350°F until golden.
