This recipe is taken from [Holly Grainger](http://www.holleygrainger.com/kid-friendly-pizza-soup/).

**Time:** 30 minutes.

**Ingredients:**

* 1 tsp. EVOO
* 1 tbsp. minced garlic
* 1 small onion, chopped
* 1 bell pepper, chopped
* Â½ lb. cooked italian chicken sausage links
* 2 tsp. basil
* 1 tsp oregano
* 32 fl. oz. low-sodium vegetable broth
* 28 oz. tomato sauce (no added salt)
* 1 can diced tomatoes (no added salt)
* Stuff you like on pizza: pepperoni, mushrooms, olives, mozzarella cheese (I haven't tried it Hawaiian style)

**Directions:**

1. Heat a large pot over medium heat. Add olive oil, garlic, onion, and bell pepper.
2. Dice the sausage into bite-size pieces and brown with the veggies. Cook until the onion is translucent; about 10 minutes.
3. Add the remaining ingredients and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 15 minutes.
4. Add toppings and serve.

**Notes:**

* If I'm adding pepperoni, I usually add it before simmering even though it's listed as a "topping". :)
