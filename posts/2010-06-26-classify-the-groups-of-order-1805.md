Classify groups of order $1805 = 5 \cdot 19^2$.

* * *

By FTFGAG, the abelian groups of order 1805 are (up to isomorphism) $Z_{1805}$ and $Z_{95} \times Z_{19}$.

Now suppose $G$ is a nonabelian group of order 1805. By Sylow's Theorem, $n_{19} = 1$; let $H$ denote the unique (hence normal) Sylow 19-subgroup of $G$. Note that $H$ must be abelian. Now let $K = \langle x \rangle \cong Z_5$ be a Sylow 5-subgroup of $G$. By Lagrange we have $H \cap K = 1$, so that $HK = G$. By the recognition theorem for semidirect products we have $G = H \rtimes_\psi K$ for some $\psi : K \rightarrow \mathsf{Aut}(H)$. Note that $\psi$ must be nontrivial, as otherwise $G \cong H \times K$ is abelian. There are two groups of order $19^2$ up to isomorphism, and thus two possibilities for the isomorphism type of $H$: $Z_{361}$ and $Z_{19}^2$. 

Suppose first that $H \cong Z_{361}$. We have that $\mathsf{Aut}(Z_{361}) \cong Z_{19 \cdot 18}$, which has no element of order 5 by Lagrange. In this case every group homomorphism $\psi : K \rightarrow \mathsf{Aut}(H)$ is trivial, a contradiction.

Thus we may assume that $H \cong Z_{19}^2$. Now $\mathsf{Aut}(H) \cong \mathsf{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_{19})$, and this group has order $123120 = 2^4 \cdot 3^4 \cdot 5 \cdot 19$. In particular, the Sylow 5-subgroups of $\mathsf{Aut}(H)$ have order 5. Because $\psi$ is nontrivial and $Z_5$ is simple, $\mathsf{im}\ \psi$ is a Sylow 5-subgroup of $\mathsf{Aut}(H)$. By Sylow's Theorem, all Sylow 5-subgroups are conjugate in $\mathsf{Aut}(H)$. Since $Z_5$ is cyclic, by [this](/math/group-theory/2010-06-25-isomorphisms-among-semidirect-products-by-a-cyclic-group.html) previous exercise, the choice of $\psi$ does not affect the isomorphism type of $G$. Thus we have $G \cong Z_{19}^2 \rtimes_\psi Z_5$, where $\psi$ is any injective homomorphism $Z_5 \rightarrow \mathsf{Aut}(Z_{19}^2)$.

To summarize, there are three groups of order 1805 as follows.

1. $Z_{1805}$
2. $Z_{95} \times Z_{19}$
3. $Z_{19}^2 \rtimes_\psi Z_5$, where $\psi : Z_5 \rightarrow \mathsf{Aut}(Z_{19}^2)$ is any injective homomorphism.

Next we will construct an explicit group of the third type and find a presentation for it. First we identify $Z_{19}^2$ with the additive group of the two-dimensional vector space $\mathbb{F}_{19}^2 = H$, and identify $\mathsf{Aut}(Z_{19}^2)$ with $\mathsf{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_{19})$. Let $A$ be the matrix $$A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 4 \end{bmatrix} \in \mathsf{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_{19}).$$ Evidently we have
$$\begin{array}{rcl}
A^2 & = & \begin{bmatrix} -1 & -4 \\ 4 & -4 \end{bmatrix}, \\
A^3 & = & \begin{bmatrix} -4 & 4 \\ -4 & -1 \end{bmatrix}, \\
A^4 & = & \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{bmatrix},\ \mathrm{and} \\
A^5 & = & I,
\end{array}$$
so that $A$ has order 5.

Let $x$ denote a generator of the cyclic group $Z_5 = K$. By [this](/math/group-theory/2010-06-17/a-lifting-property-for-finite-abelian-groups.html) prior result, there is a unique group homomorphism $\varphi : Z_5 \rightarrow \mathsf{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_{19})$ such that $\varphi(x) = A$. Define $G = \mathbb{F}_{19}^2 \rtimes_\varphi Z_5$; certainly this group has order 1805.

Now we find a presentation for this group. First, note that in general if $H$ is generated by $S$ and $K$ is generated by $T$, then (identifying factors with subgroups) the semidirect product $H \rtimes K$ is generated by $S \cup T$. In this case, $G$ is generated by $$\mu = \left(\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, 1\right), \eta = \left(\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, 1\right),\ \mathrm{and}\ \omega = \left(\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, x\right).$$

Certainly $\mu \eta = \eta \mu$.

We have $$\omega \mu = (1,x)\left(\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, 1\right) = \left(A\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, x\right) = \left(\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, x\right) = \eta \omega$$ and similarly $$\omega \eta = (1,x)\left(\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, 1\right) = \left(\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}, x\right) = \mu^{-1} \eta^4 \omega.$$

Finally, note that $A \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$; it is straightforward to show that $\mu \omega = \omega \mu^{-1} \eta^4$.

Thus $G$ has the presentation $$\left\langle \mu, \eta, \omega \;\middle\vert\; \begin{matrix} \mu^{19} = \eta^{19} = \omega^5 = 1, \mu \eta = \eta \mu, \\ \omega \mu = \eta \omega, \omega \eta = \mu^{-1} \eta^4 \omega, \mu \omega = \omega \mu^{-1} \eta^4 \end{matrix} \right\rangle.$$
