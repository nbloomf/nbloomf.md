> 六祖、因風颺刹幡。有二僧、對論。
> 一云、幡動。一云、風動。
> 往復曾未契理。
> 祖云、不是風動、不是幡動、仁者心動。
> 二僧悚然。

> The wind was flapping a temple flag, and two monks started an argument.
> One said the flag moved, the other said the wind moved;
> they argued back and forth but could not reach a conclusion.
> The Sixth Patriarch said, "It is not the wind that moves, it is not the flag that moves; it is your mind that moves."
> The two monks were awe-struck.
