### Activities

1. [Limits](/pdf/classes/calc/calc-a01-limits.pdf) ([solutions](/pdf/classes/calc/calc-soln-a01-limits.pdf))
2. [Continuity](/pdf/classes/calc/calc-a02-continuity.pdf) ([solutions](/pdf/classes/calc/calc-soln-a02-continuity.pdf))


## Practice Problems (Not Graded!)

* Test 1
    * 2.4 #1abcdjkl, 2adegjk
    * 2.2 #1,2,11--42
    * 2.5 #13--18, 39, 40, 43, 44
    * 3.1 #5--22, 25--28

Fun fact: "calculus" is a scary word that simply means "a system of rules for manipulating symbols"; there are lots of different calculuses (calculi?).
